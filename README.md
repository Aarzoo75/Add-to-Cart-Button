# Add to Cart Button

This is a sample code to create an "Add to cart" button using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

In the HTML code, the button is created using a `<button>` element, and a `<div>` element is used to create the cart icon. The icon is created using several nested `<div>` elements. There are several other `<div>` elements used for different purposes like "notification success" and "notification cancel".

The CSS code is used to style the button and the cart icon. It sets the background color of the button to yellow, and styles it to have a black color text and a yellow background. It also sets the background color of the `<div>` element for the cart icon to gray.

The JavaScript code is not provided here, but it can be used to perform different actions when the button is clicked. This could include things like adding an item to the cart and updating the total price.

Please note that this code is only an example and you will need to integrate it with a back-end solution and or make the appropriate adjustments to add it to your application.
